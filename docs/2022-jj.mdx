<Accordion title="JetBrains 4.1.0: Introducing Search Everywhere">
    Introducing Search Everywhere in Pieces for JetBrains!

    We know that staying deep in your flow is the best way to make the most of your time, and as you add more snippets to Pieces, search becomes increasingly critical and searching within your tools is a must have. Today we’re excited to release Search Everywhere for the JetBrains suite. This feature gives you three ways to find and insert snippets from Pieces - via right-click, Auto-Complete or Search Everywhere.

<Accordion title="Shareable links land in plugins">
    We’ve gotten fantastic feedback from users since last week’s mega release of one-click Snippet Sharing from the Pieces for Developers desktop app!

    We’re not surprised - devs share snippets constantly, but most tools like Slack or Discord struggle to present and index code as code for readers. Sharing snippets via Pieces couldn’t be easier, and recipients benefit from improved formatting, syntax highlighting, tags and related links, which means your recipients receive both the code AND the context around that code.

<Accordion title="1.6.0: Share snippets with one click">
    We’ve been eagerly anticipating today’s release for a LONG time! When we first decided to build Pieces, we started with ensuring an amazing “single-player experience” for developers to save, enrich and re-use their snippets seamlessly throughout their day. But we knew we eventually wanted to make sharing snippets with teammates 10x better. Today marks the release of Snippet Sharing in Pieces!

    There are two more massive upgrades in today’s release:

    The Pieces AI assistant now auto-generates tags for your saved snippets so you can find things more easily later.
    And Pieces is now ~5x faster across the board for saving, scrolling, searching… pretty much every action just got massively faster.
