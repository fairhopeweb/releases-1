This week’s JetBrains Suite release is deeply focused on improving usability, including a new tree view, drag and drop, snippet sharing and more.
## Tree view
Now, you can view a list of your saved snippets in a tree inside your editor. Snippets are grouped by language and listed according to the snippet’s name.

Being able to easily view and scan your snippets also enables a bunch of other really cool features, such as…
## Drag and drop snippets
Drag a snippet from the tree view and drop it exactly where you want it. No more right-clicks, copying and pasting or searching the Pieces desktop app for a specific snippet— just locate the snippet in the tree and drag it into your editor.

## Manage snippets right inside the JetBrains suite
