## Upgraded Markdown Preview
When you preview a snippet, it pops up as a Markdown preview in a new window. That preview is now reactive! When you right-click your snippet in tree view, you can add links or tags. Then, once you hit enter, the preview automatically updates.

## Bug Fixes and User Experience Improvements
- Previously, you may have gotten a series of “Failed to Connect to Pieces OS” messages when you added metadata to a snippet— Now, you’ll get one notification instead.
- If you try to generate a shareable link but you’re not signed in or connected to the cloud, now you’ll see a “Sign in” button with the error message.
- We’ve added a 3-second timeout on success messages when you add metadata.
- The onboarding flow now pops up in a window in VS Code instead of redirecting to the web to reduce the disruption to your day.
- The plugin icon is now a puzzle piece.
