This week, we’ve made improvements to the little things that make your workflow smoother, particularly around better auto-detection of snippets on webpages and improved stability between Chrome and Pieces OS.
## Saving Snippets
- Attention Windows users! Quickly save snippets with our new keyboard shortcut: ALT + SHIFT + P
- On some web pages, the “Save to Pieces” button overlapped with the “Copy” button. We’ve fixed that— now “Save to Pieces” and “Copy” are side-by-side.
- We’ve also improved Pieces’ ability to identify code blocks on web pages, so you can more easily save a snippet of any size.
## Reimagined Onboarding
Thanks to your feedback, we realized we needed to reimagine our onboarding process. When you install the Pieces for Chrome Extension, you’ll be directed to a landing page that checks to ensure that you’ve also installed Pieces OS and provides easy instructions to save your first piece.

As a reminder, Pieces OS is the background service that enables Pieces to work locally and handles communications with any integrations.
## Connectivity Improvements
We’ve improved the connection to Pieces OS to make sure that all of your saved snippets are accurately saved to Pieces. There were formerly some issues with Pieces not being saved if Pieces OS had been closed and reopened, but they’re now instantly ready for use.
Plus, we’ve baked in some performance improvements that make your experience with Pieces smarter, faster and better all-around.
